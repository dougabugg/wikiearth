Basically like wikipedia, except anyone is allowed to write an article about anything, from any point of view, about anything on earth. There will be methods of "culling" irrelevant info from the "official" repository; for example, you could create an article about your own property and house, but it isn't relevant on the scale of the "world map" with countries and geopolitis, so it wouldn't be included in that scope. However, a real-world land mark or important building that is relevant and public, would be included.
